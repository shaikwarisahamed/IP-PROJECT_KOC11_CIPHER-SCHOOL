    <h1>Healthy tips
    </h1>
    <p>
        <h2>1. Read the Menu Before You Go</h2>
        If you’re not familiar with the menu, read it before you get to the restaurant.
        
        You’re more likely to make unhealthy choices when hungry or distracted (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).
        
        The sight and smell of food can make sticking to a plan more difficult, especially if you are hungry (7Trusted Source).
        
        Choosing your food before you arrive makes it easier to avoid snap decisions you might regret later.
        <p> <h2> 2. Have a Healthy Snack Before You Arrive</h2>
            If you’re hungry when you arrive at a restaurant, you may end up eating too much. One way to prevent this is to eat a healthy snack before you get there.
            
            A low-calorie, high-protein snack like yogurt could make you feel more full and help prevent overeating (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).
             </p>
        
        
      
        <p><h2>3. Drink Water Before and During Your Meal
            </h2>Water is a fantastic choice for drinking before and with a meal, especially if you drink it instead of sugar-sweetened drinks.
            
            Replacing sugar-sweetened drinks with water can help reduce your intake of calories and added sugar (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).
            
            One study showed that people on a diet who drank 500 ml (17 oz) of water half an hour before a meal ate fewer calories and lost 44% more weight than those who didn’t (16Trusted Source).</p>
        <p><h2>4. Check How Food is Cooked and Prepared</h2>
            The way food is cooked can have a significant impact on the amount of calories it contains.
        
            Look for food that has been steamed, grilled, roasted or poached. In general, these cooking methods equate to less fat and therefore fewer calories.
            
            Foods that are described on the menu as pan-fried, fried, crispy, crunchy or sautéed will usually contain more fat and more calories.</p>
        
        
        
        <p><h2>
            5. Try Eating Your Meal Mindfully</h2> Mindful eating means making conscious choices about what you consume and giving your full attention to the eating process.
        
            Take the time to savor the aromas and flavors of your meal, as well as thoughts and feelings that arise while you eat (17Trusted Source).
            
            Mindful eating has been linked with healthier food choices in restaurants (18Trusted Source).
            
            It can also help improve your self-control and prevent you from overeating (19Trusted Source).

       <p><h2> 6. Order Your Meal Before Everyone Else</h2> Other people can influence our decisions without us really noticing.
        
        In social situations, people tend to mimic each other subconsciously, and dining out is no exception.
        
        People’s menu choices and eating behaviors can be highly influenced by the choices of other people at the table (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).
        
        If you’re eating with a group that is likely to order something that doesn’t fit into your healthy eating plan, make sure you order first.</p>
       
        
        <p><h2>7. Order Two Appetizers Instead of a Main</h2>Studies show that people are more likely to overeat when they’re served bigger portions (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
        
            If you are going to a restaurant where you know the portions are huge, try ordering two appetizers instead of a main course.
            
            This can help you fill up without going overboard with the calories.</p>
        <p><h2> 8. Slow Down and Chew Thoroughly</h2>
            Chewing your food thoroughly and eating slower could help you eat less. It can also make you feel full more quickly (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source).
            
            When you’re eating, try counting a minimum number of chews per mouthful to stop yourself from eating too quickly.
            
            Putting your utensils down between mouthfuls is also a good way to slow down and give your satiety signals some time to kick in.</p>
        
       
        
        <p><h2>9. Have a Cup of Coffee Instead of Dessert</h2>Skip dessert and order a coffee instead.
        
            As well as seriously cutting calories and added sugar, you’ll also get some of the great health benefits associated with coffee.</p>
        <p><h2> 10. Avoid All-You-Can-Eat Buffets</h2>
            People are notoriously bad at estimating portion sizes (29Trusted Source).
            
            So when you are faced with an unlimited supply of food at a buffet, eating the right amount can be challenging.
            
            If you’re stuck with a buffet as your only choice, using a smaller plate might help you eat less (30Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
            
            Another effective trick is to use a normal-sized plate and fill half of it with salad or vegetables (32Trusted Source).
